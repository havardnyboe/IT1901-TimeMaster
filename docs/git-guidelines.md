Example on a good and a bad commit.


## issues

An issue shall:

- describe the task on hand
- be relevant to the project
- be tied to an milestone
- be marked with a tag


## branching

All work shall be done on a seperate branch, "master" shall not be used. This ensures a working "master" at all times. 

The work done on a branch shall be within the same task/area. This means that if we change tasks, we change branches. 

## merge requests

When the work is completed, the branch is to be merged into "master". They will be compared, and merge conflicts are to be resolved. 

A merge request is set up, and another member of the team shall look at it and approve the merge request.
