# Time Master

Time Master is an app which keeps track of the employees hours. Its purpose is to make it easier for employees to register when their shift starts and ends. It saves the information digitally, and is therefore easy to access for both employees and employer. 

Employees have the opportunity to look at their previous hours. If there is something wrong with them, the employee is able to edit them.


### Scenario
Magnus arrives at his place of work around ten, he works at a restaurant. Magnus registers at what hour and minute he arrives, by using the Time Master App. He fills out the corresponding fields and clicks on the “Check in” button. Magnus is a hard working guy, and he keeps at it for a long time. He treats himself to a “stengepils” after all the customers have left. After he has cleaned up and drunk his beer, he clocks out in the same manner as he clocked in.

Magnus is back at work the day after. Payday is coming up soon and he wants to check how many hours he has worked. He discovers that he might have been a bit “skeiv i skøytene” when he left work yesterday, because his hours from yesterday are completely off. Luckily, Magnus is able to edit his hours. Magnus got paid what he had earned, and was finally able to buy the boat he wanted.

Amalie works as a manager at the restaurant and want to hire new people. In the Time Master App she can easily add a new employee by navigating to the "Add New Employee" tab. All she has to do is enter the employees name and click the "Add Employee" button. Happily after adding all the new employees she can join Magnus while he drinks his “stengepils”.
