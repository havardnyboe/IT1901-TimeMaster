/**
 * Employee is a class to store data about employees in the application.
 * It depends on Workday to store an employees working hours.
 * An Employee object encapsulates the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The employees id
 * <li>The employees name
 * <li>The employees list of Workdays
 * <li>The employees status (at work or not)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The id is generated with java.util.UUID
 *
 * <p>The name is supplied through the constructor as has to follow spesific rules.
 * //TODO: Insert regex rule
 * 
 * <p>An employees Workdays are stored in an ArrayList.
 * This makes it easy to access all listed workdays as the data
 * should be easily altered.
 *
 * <p>The Employee object stores an atWork field to store the state
 * across sessions. As long as the Employee object is stated at work,
 * the latest workday has to be closed before a new one can be created.
